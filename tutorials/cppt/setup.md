# Setup

So now we have seen what is C++. Now we will move on to the setup.

## Visual Studio IDE

Visual Studio is an excellent IDE made by Microsoft. It is used for C++, .NET, Python and JavaScript. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10_VxljbsR0&list=PLmWXQgLAMBwGqz9EpLcquRsbP4wF1RwNb&index=1) to see how to install Visual Studio. Be sure to download community edition.

## Alternatives

If you don't want to downlad visual studio you have the following alternatives.
* If you are on Windows you can download MinGW i.e. Windows version of GCC compiler from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/). Compile the code using `g++ inputfile.cpp -o outputfile.exe` or `g++ inputfile.cpp -o outputfile.exe -l(library name)`.
* If you are on Windows or Mac you can download Clang compiler online. Compile the code using `clang inputfile.cpp`.
* If you are on a Linux Platform I guess you don't need to dowload any compiler as GCC compiler is inbuilt.
* Visual Studio equivalent for Mac is XCode
* You can use a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text or Notepad++ for better code editing.  

In the next page we are going to discuss basic C++ syntax.
