# Introduction to C++

What is C++?

C++ is a popular programming language which can write codes at both processor level and application level. Using this language, we can develop a variety, from operating systems to software or toolkits we use for various daily life and other purposes. See! Can you imagine such a wide range of applications for just a single language? And some concepts of this like object oriented are really very simple! This is the reason it is one of my favourite programming languages.

So are you excited to learn C++? Let us get started.

# C++ Compilers

You can use GCC as a compiler and Notepad++ as a code editor. Or else even you can use the Visual Studio along with VSCode(Visual Studio Code). Note that if you want it free, don't take professional or enterprise version because it is free only up till 30 days or if you keep siged in, up till 90 days. Take community version of Visual Studio, just remember it can not be used for business. You can also use Code::blocks as a code editor and IDE. You can also take CLion, just remember that it is paid.

# C++ "Hello World"

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
```
Hello World
```
I know that at start this code may seem difficult, but as soon as you understand it, it is nothing more than half a piece of cake.  
Now, just note that this C++ tutorial will not be able to make you understand everything clearly, but can obviously provide you the things like the import links and all.  
Also, you can grab the code from here for editing. But if you really want all the proper explanations, then see our [C++ Course on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmWXQgLAMBwGqz9EpLcquRsbP4wF1RwNb).
