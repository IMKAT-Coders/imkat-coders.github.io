# C++ Compilers

You can use GCC as a compiler and Notepad++ as a code editor. Or else even you can use the Visual Studio along with VSCode(Visual Studio Code). Note that if you want it free, don't take professional or enterprise version because it is free only up till 30 days or if you keep siged in, up till 90 days. Take community version of Visual Studio, just remember it can not be used for business. You can also use Code::blocks as a code editor and IDE. You can also take CLion, just remember that it is paid.
