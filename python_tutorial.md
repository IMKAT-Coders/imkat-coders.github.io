# Introduction to Python

What is Python?

Python is a very popular programming language. This language is easy to learn, and yet, we can build cool applications with it with lots of cool features. And that is why it is my favourite programming language too!

So are you excited to learn Python? 
Lets get started

# Basic Python Syntax

Ok, so now after a brief introduction to Python, lets move towards the actual coding part. Download Python with the help of [this video](https://youtu.be/kV69k0kK6BM) from [python.org](python.org). See the code below, which will output 'Hello World'. 
```python
print('Hello World')
```
Now, did you see how easy it is? And that is the main reason Python is so popular.  
Now, just note that this Python tutorial will not be able to make you understand everything clearly, but can obviously provide you the things like the import links and all.  
Also, you can grab the code from here for editing. But if you really want all the proper explanations, then see our [Python Course on Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmWXQgLAMBwHvlK34hUbFjiQ4CztrRoL8).

So now let us move on to Python Variables
