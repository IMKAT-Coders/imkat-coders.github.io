# Basic Python Syntax

Ok, so now after a brief introduction to Python, lets move towards the actual coding part.

Download Python with the help of [this video](https://youtu.be/kV69k0kK6BM) from [python.org](python.org). Also, dowload PyCharm, which is a very popular IDE for python from [jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/). Be sure to download the community edition which is free of cost.

See the code below, which will output 'Hello World'.  
Every time when you see a code like this, the output will be given in the box below.
```python
print('Hello World')
```
```
Hello World
```

Now, did you see how easy it is? And that is the main reason Python is so popular.

Now, just note that this Python tutorial will not be able to make you understand everything clearly, but can obviously provide you the things like the important links and all.  
Also, you can grab the code from here for editing. But if you really want all the proper explanations, then see my [Python Course on Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmWXQgLAMBwHvlK34hUbFjiQ4CztrRoL8).

So now let us move on to Python Variables
