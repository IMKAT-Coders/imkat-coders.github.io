# Float

Float is a data type which can hold values wit floating point numbers. To simplify this, float is a data type which can have a number with a decimal point. So it is very easy and also doesn't need much explanation. So we will just see a code example and stop.
```python
number = 12.345
print(number)
```
```
12.345
```

This is an example with variables. But variables take up memory, so we can even directly print the value like this.
```python
print(12.345)
```
```
12.345
```

So that's it for floats now.
