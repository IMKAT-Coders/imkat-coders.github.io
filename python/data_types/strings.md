# String

String is a sequence of characters. So, to simplify this, we can say that a string is basically some group of letters, numbers and signs, just like sentences. But the only thing that differentiates strings from normal sentences is that a string must be in quotation marks where as sentences shall not necessarily be. So lets take an example of our first 'Hello World' code.
```python
print('Hello World')
```
```
Hello World
```

So in this simple example, 'Hello World' is a string. Lets take another example with variables and strings.
```python
text = 'Hello World'
print(text)
```
```
Hello World
```

This is also an example which we saw earlier in the varables section. So over hee too, 'Hello World' is a string. We will talk about strings in the later part of this tutorial. So lets stop with it now
