# Integer

Now, Integers, as you know, are integers in maths. So no need to explain it. But still for convenience,  I will show you a sample code.
```python
integer = 13
print(integer)
```
```
13
```

Now see that integers are not stored in quotation marks. And to print integers without using variables, use this type of code.
```python
print(13)
```
```
13
```
So thats all about integers for now.
