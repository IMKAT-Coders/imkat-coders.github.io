# Boolean

Now boolean is a really different data type which can store only 2 values: True and False.

Now these True and False values should start with capital letters and not small, becuase python is case sensetive.  
Also, these values shall not be in quotation marks.

So lets take a look at a few examples.
```python
is_online = True
print(is_online)
```
```
True
```

Without variables, it will be like.
```python
print(True)
```
```
True
```

Or, with False.
```python
is_online = False
print(is_online)
```
```
False
```

Ok, so thats it for booleans now. And this ends our Data Types section. Now next, we are going to cover a very interesting topic.
