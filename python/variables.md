# Python Variables

Python Variables are type of boxes in real life, which store something. So now lets take a look at this simple code containing variables.
```python
text = "Hello World"
print(text)
```
```
Hello World
```

You see, we made a so called box in which we stored the text 'Hello World' and labeled that box as 'text'.

Now note that while prinitng that variable called text (referred as box), I didn't use quotation marks. Because if I do, then the variable name 'text' will be printed on the screen. Now this is just the basic part of variables. We will learn more about them in the next section, in which we will study data types.
