# User Input in Python

Now user input in Python is really important because without that, the program first of all becomes boring. This is because if user doesnt get any chance of giving any input, then he can get bored. Thats not the point. But still, user input plays an important role in Python Programming. So lets directly jump into a sample code.
```python
name = input('Enter your name: ')
print('Hello ' + name + '!')
```
```
Enter your name: Ishan
Hello Ishan!
```

Now by observing the code, you shall get the basic idea about user input and its syntax. So lets not discuss about it more in this section, because it has a lot to do in the next section!
